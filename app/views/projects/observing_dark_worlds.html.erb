          Due to its enormous mass, Dark Matter warps and bends spacetime which causes the path of light from a background
          galaxy to change, altering the ellipticity of the observed galaxy. <br>
          The <%= link_to 'Observing Dark Worlds','https://www.kaggle.com/c/DarkWorlds'%> Kaggle competition asks
          competitors to estimate the location of the Dark Matter from the simulated galaxy data. <br>
          <br>
          300 simulated skies are provided as training data, 120 simulated skies as test data.
          Each sky contains between 300 - 740 galaxies and 1,2 or 3 dark matters. <br>
          The provided data is limited, which makes bayesian inference very useful. Priors and models for parameters could
          be estimated from the training data which we could then use in the calculation for test data.<br>

          The <%= link_to 'tutorial page on dark matter', 'http://blog.kaggle.com/2012/10/12/observing-dark-worlds-a-beginners-guide-to-dark-matter-how-to-find-it/'%>
          provided the relationship between dark matter and galaxy:<br>
          galaxy ellipticity = mass of dark matter / radial distance to galaxy <br>
          The provided data contains the galaxy position and the two tangential component of each galaxy's ellipticity.<br>

          Halos(dark matter) could be any where in the sky, and the probability at each location is uniform: <br>
            halo position (x,y) ~ Uniform(0,4200) <br>
          Observe the tangential ellipticity follow a normal distribution with variance 0.05: <br>

        <%= link_to 'source code','https://github.com/luliu31415926/observing_dark_worlds'%>
        <article>
          The inference is implemented with Python package <%= link_to 'PyMC3' ,'http://pymc3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/'%>.<br>
          <br>
          In order to obtain the distribution of the dark matter mass, we need to make bayesian inference from the provided training data.<br>
          1/3 of the training skies contain only 1 halo. With limited computing resource, I only focused on those skies.<br>
          By setting the halos position as observed variable, and providing a big range uniform distribution (0,1000) for the mass,
          I ran MAP inference for the mass for the 100 skies with 1 halo. <br>
          <br>
          hist plot of MAP estimation for the halo masses<br>
          <%= image_tag("observing_dark_words/mass_distribution.png", :alt => "distribution of mass MAP estimation") %>  <br>
          The plot seem to indicate two gaussian distributions, but without enough data it is too risky to make such an assumption.<br>
          In order to avoid overfitting, I decided to use a uniform model for the mass with range (0,180)
          <br>
          With a model for all the parameters I need, I can start making inference for the halo position.<br>
          Limited by computing resource, I couldn't run as much sampling as I like. but I obtained good enough result for visualization. <br>
          <br>
          Sampling traceplot for one sky, shows the model converged very well.<br>
          <%= image_tag("observing_dark_words/samping_traceplot.png", :alt => "traceplot") %>  <br>
          <br>
          Now we can plot the sampled points on the sky to compare with the true halo position. <br>
